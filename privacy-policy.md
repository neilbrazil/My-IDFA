# 1. Introduction
My IDFA Identifier ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data when you use our app.

# 2. Data We Collect
Our app requests access to your device's Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) through Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework.

We do not collect, store, or share any personal data. The only information retrieved is the IDFA, which is displayed within the app for your reference.

# 3. How We Use Your Data
The IDFA is used solely to be displayed to you within the app. We do not:

Track you across other apps or websites
Store or transmit your IDFA to external servers

# 4. Permissions & App Tracking Transparency (ATT)
Apple requires that we ask for permission before accessing your IDFA. When you first open the app, you will see a prompt requesting permission.

If you allow tracking, the app will retrieve and display your IDFA.
If you deny tracking, the app will not access or display your IDFA.
Regardless of your choice, our app does not use the IDFA for tracking purposes.
